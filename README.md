# Home Automation with the D1 Mini Pro and Blynk 

## Introduction
I needed a simple way to monitor the ambient temperature of my mining rigs as well as automate shutdowns and send notifications/turn on ventilation as required. I had some D1 Mini Pros lying around with various shields so I threw together a temperature sensor for less than $8 in parts. 

I think there are many other opportunities to explore and don't want to spend more than a day on each feature.

## Done
* A temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 feeds data to Blynk to monitor mining rig ambient temperatures (16 Feb 2018)

## In the pipeline
* I have an Anova but I think I might be able to do more with an ESP8266 version of the sous vide machine to make eggs in the morning. It's wireless, I can remote control them through blynk and check on them in bed.
* Automatic power cut for mining rigs + fan on/off for mining rigs
